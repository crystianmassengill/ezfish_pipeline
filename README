Pipeline steps:
PreProcessing - Manually:
- create a copy of examples/demo.json and change the variable to match the new experiment, save it as mouse_name.json
- copy the relevant files (HCR/2P) to the relevant folder (look at examples/file_structure.txt)
- run the pipeline with the new json file


1. parse manifest
2. validate manifest
3. process sbx files (A):
    - transform sbx to tiff
    - output files:
        - 
4. unwarp tiff files (A):
    - take each plane and use remap & unwarp_config to fix the ???? <-- JONNA
    - output files:
        -
5. stitch tiff files (M):
    - take each plane and stitch them together manually using bigsticher
6. register HCR rounds (SA)
    - run 1_scan_lowres_parameters.ipynb with the correct hjson file
    - find the correct paramters that are good for lowres
    - run_2_scan_highres_parameters.ipynb with the correct hjson file






A - Automatic
M - Manual
SA - Semi-Automatic
